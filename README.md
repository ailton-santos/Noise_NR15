#NR15 (ANNEX 1 - TOLERANCE LIMITS FOR CONTINUOUS OR INTERMITTENT NOISE)
## Ailton Santos

This program asks the user for the sound pressure level measured in decibels (dB) and the noise exposure time in hours. It then calculates the Noise Dose Index (RDI) and classifies the risk according to the RDI value. The fold level is the amount of noise level reduction that is desired, and is commonly used in noise control measures in work environments.
